root2hdf is a simple bash script which generates a program for
converting ROOT TTrees into HDF5 datasets.

The only requirements for using it are having ROOT and HDF5 properly
installed.

Currently root2hdf supports TTrees with branch types that are basic
types (Char_t, Int_t, Float_t, etc.) or arrays of the basic types; no
compound types are supported (yet?).

To see usage options just run root2hdf without any arguments.
